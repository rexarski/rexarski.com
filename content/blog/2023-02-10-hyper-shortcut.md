TIL <kbd>Command ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift ⇧</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> is a keyboard combination that [rules them all](https://utgd.net/article/10042). Whenever in doubt, call it out and guess the name of action you want to try. It serves as a fuzzy searcher of a Mac app menu bar.

It's brilliant. I'll give it that. But my personal choice of favorite is CapsLock. I use [this key modification rule](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#hyper_key) on Karabiner to repurpose my left pinkie's favorite landing spot. The best part is, it still acts like before when pressed alone. Basically I use it in various applications for the most frequently go-to actions:

- In Obsidian, <kbd>hyper</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> is calling omnisearch.
- In Fantastical, <kbd>hyper</kbd> + f` is creating a new event/reminder.
- In Moom, <kbd>hyper</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd> is activating window management.
