**Updated on 2022-09-14:** Made some changes to the procedure. I'll keep the [repository](https://github.com/rexarski/toolbox) updated on GitHub.

There are some things that we don't need to recite fluently, but rather to keep them in a memo. Like the following a couple of things to do when I set up a new Mac.

- [ ] Set up iCloud account.
  - Turn off the iCloud sync of Photos before library migration.
- [ ] Install Chrome.
- [ ] Install 1Password.
- [ ] Install Google Drive, Dropbox.
- [ ] Install [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
- [ ] Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
- [ ] Install iTerm 2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- [ ] [Change computer and host name](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66611/how-to-change-computer-name-so-terminal-displays-it-in-mac-os-x-mountain-lion):
  - `sudo scutil --set ComputerName "newname"`
  - `sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "newname"`
  - `sudo scutil --set HostName "newname"`
- [ ] Stop Time Machine local snapshots.
  - `tmutil disablelocal` was deprecated since Mojave. Use  [TimeMachineEditor](https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/) instead.
- [ ] Create a global `gitignore` file at `~/.gitignore`.
  - See [this one](/config/.gitignore) as an example.
  - `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`
- [ ] Generate and add SSH key to GitHub account.

As GitHub stopped supporting users from using account passwords for authenticated Git operations.

We need to do the following set up:

1. Generate an SSH key on the new device as no SSH keys exist inside `.ssh`
    - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “email@example.com”`
    - Enter the path with filename `/Users/myname/.ssh/id_ed25519_github` after the prompt
    - Enter a passphrase (optional), then `id_ed25519_github` and `id_ed25519_github.pub` will appear
2. Add the SSH key to ssh-agent
    - Start the ssh-agent by `exec ssh-agent zsh`
    - Add newly created SSH private key to the ssh-agent by `ssh-add —apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`
    - Create a config file `touch ~/.ssh/config` with:

```plaintext
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

3. Add the SSH key to GitHub account
- `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub`
- On GitHub, Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key

4. Additionally, inside `.git/config`, use SSH url instead of HTTPS url.

I've also created a list of applications and something more that I consider as "essential ones" in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rexarski/toolbox).

New device, new environment, new day.
