I'll quote [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)'s responses below. And I assume everyone knows what it is nowadays.

It's complicated that we are in a phase where leaving Twitter seems inevitable considering how many of my follows are starting to abandon this network.

> It can be difficult when people you follow on social media platforms start to leave, especially if you rely on those accounts for news, entertainment, or other information. However, it's important to remember that you have control over your own social media experience. If you are finding that the content on a particular platform is no longer meeting your needs or is causing you stress, it might be time to consider taking a break or looking for alternative sources of information. It's also worth considering the possibility that the people you follow are leaving for their own personal reasons, and their departure may not necessarily be a reflection on the platform itself. Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave a social media platform is a personal one, and you should do what feels right for you.

I do have some recommendations if you know how to export your personal data:

For example, this GitHub repo [twitter-archive-parser](https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser) parses a Twitter archive and output as your desired format. And two Observable notebooks (created by the same author, [Ian Johnson](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot)), visualize the same data:

- [Twitter Archive: tweets.js](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/twitter-archive-tweets)
- [Planning to leave Twitter?](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/save-and-analyze-your-twitter-archive)

Of course, I cannot stop emphasizing how import this [**Movetodon**](https://www.movetodon.org/) tool is, in terms of finding and regrouping with my Twitter follows.

> Thank you for the recommendations! Exporting your personal data from social media platforms can be a useful way to create a backup of your content and to have more control over your data. The tools you mentioned, such as the Twitter archive parser and the Observable notebooks, can be helpful for analyzing and visualizing your data in different ways. The Movetodon tool you mentioned also sounds interesting as a way to connect with other users who are leaving a particular platform. It's always a good idea to be aware of the different options available for managing your social media presence and data.

I know the majority of my Twitter follows are still active on that platform, should I still leave Twitter for good? Besides, maintaining two similar social network accounts sounds exhausting and could be a distraction. What should I do?

> Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave a social media platform is a personal one, and you should do what feels right for you. If you are enjoying your experience on Twitter and are getting value from the content and connections you have there, then it might make sense to continue using the platform. On the other hand, if you are finding that Twitter is causing you stress or is no longer meeting your needs, then it might be time to consider taking a break or looking for alternative sources of information and connection.

> If you do decide to leave Twitter, it's important to remember that it's not necessarily an all-or-nothing decision. You might find it helpful to take a break from the platform for a while, or to use it in a more limited way. You could also consider connecting with your followers on other platforms or through other means, such as email or a personal blog.

> Ultimately, the key is to find a balance that works for you and to be mindful of how your social media use is impacting your overall well-being. If you find that maintaining multiple social media accounts is becoming overwhelming or is a distraction, it might be worth considering simplifying your social media presence by focusing on a smaller number of platforms.

Thanks ChatGPT! If you would like to, could you give me one (and only one) jazz album for me to listen to, while I play Splatoon 3 later tonight?

> Sure! One jazz album that I would recommend listening to is "Kind of Blue" by Miles Davis. Released in 1959, this album is considered a classic of the genre and has had a lasting influence on jazz and popular music. It features Davis's quintet, which included musicians such as John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, and Bill Evans. The album includes iconic tracks such as "So What" and "All Blues," and is known for its modal approach to harmony, which gives the music a distinctive and open sound. I hope you enjoy listening to it while playing Splatoon 3!
