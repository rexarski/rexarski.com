I'd like to join the chaotic battle of [defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) and probably it won't matter at all. Haven't checked out the podcast episode here but, hey, we are talking about default apps here. I've been [keeping track of my own app selections](https://github.com/rexarski/toolbox/) and would love to share my own, which is sort of a *lite* version.
