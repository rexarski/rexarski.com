Accidentally changed the default font of macOS Mail.app, and was super surprised to see there's no option to "reset to defaults". Plus, there's no other ways to select a "system font".

Found the following post [StackExchange - How do I choose "System Font" in the font picker?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/424754/how-do-i-choose-system-font-in-the-font-picker) to work around. Also improvised a little bit to reset both fixed-width and message fonts. (You need to view the binary file at `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist` to identify the attribute names but I've done the heavy lifting for you.)

```bash
defaults delete -app Mail NSFont
defaults delete -app Mail NSFixedPitchFont
defaults delete -app Mail MessageListFont
defaults delete -app Mail NSFixedPitchFontSize
defaults delete -app Mail NSFontSize
```

It worked.
