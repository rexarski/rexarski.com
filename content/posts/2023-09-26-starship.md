So the story begins with an acquisition, which is something worth celebrating. [Fig](https://fig.io/) is acquired by AWS. Although speculators claim that the developers are probably acqui-hired. As a long-term user, I'm happy for them. I have been using Fig as my iTerm companion / zsh buddy for a few years, maybe even from the very beginning?

But for a product, as commercial as it is, not an open-source project, if I don't see its future, gotta say this line:

> Thank you, next

**Something I realize after uninstalling Fig is that some needs are not compulsory but created.**

And **simplicity is beauty**.

The major issue is that I need to reinstall oh-my-zsh because my prior installation was bundled with Fig. The same goes with some zsh plugins. Luckily, I don't have too many to deal with:

- [x] <https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh>
- [x] <https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting>
- [x] <https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions>
- [x] <https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use>

In terms of customization of the prompt, I am torn between [spaceship](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/getting-started/) and [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship). And I picked starship because it seems to be more minimalistic and easier to install.

```bash
# oh-my-zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# starship prompt
brew install starship

# zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# you-should-use
git clone https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/you-should-use

# add two lines of aliases in .zshrc file
alias pip=pip3
alias python=python
```

Installed a compatible theme:

```bash
# Snazzy theme
(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy/main/Snazzy.itermcolors > /tmp/Snazzy.itermcolors && open /tmp/Snazzy.itermcolors)
```

Additionally, I installed a [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (FYI: not your ordinary font that supports ligature!) for starship prompt and switched to its official [Tokyo Night preset](https://starship.rs/presets/tokyo-night.html).
