Ah, here we go again.

At some point, I feel like the [old blog](https://github.com/rexarski/2nd-blog) needs a revamp, just like [its predecessor](https://github.com/rexarski/1st-blog).

One driving force is I want to keep things *simple*, and the last design I chose was not. (Or I gradually changed my mind.)

I decided not to migrate all the gibberish to this one, as I'm shifting to a new stage of my life this year. What I want to express here should be more sophisticated, rather than two liners rephrasing an article I read. With that being said, I still enjoy journaling daily errands on [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/). The difference is that this place is more or less for in-depth thoughts exclusively.

That's my idea at this point. Let's see where it can take me to.

It's lights out and away we go!
