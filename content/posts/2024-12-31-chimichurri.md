So apparently I jotted down this draft after making a successful rendition of Chimichurri sauce:

- Olive oil
- Red wine vinegar (I think both my wife and I are huge fans of this)
- Garlic
- Red pepper flakes
- Parsley, chopped
- Oregano (fresh or dried)

Perfect for marinating or dipping meat-based food like steak.
